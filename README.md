## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a full stack developer working primarily on iOS mobile development and am an Adjunct professor teaching in areas of software development.

I'm currently learning AI with Copilot on github.

My personal websites: 
- [KrakenMobi LLC](https://www.krakenmobi.com/) is for my Mobile Application LLC
- [Code-Gorilla](https://www.code-gorilla.com/) is where I share my knowledge
